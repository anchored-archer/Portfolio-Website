        <h4>Web Dev</h4>
        <p>
        Hello, I am on my little journey of web development: I started with python; SQL and finally a little password manager; this website --- that's it? 
        I am not gonna claim that i am good at anything i do, but most of the time i do get things done; stuff learnt along the way.
        When someone talks of progrmming this is what i imagine: A nerd spending their days with their head tucked into the screen; running with a loud scream when they see some peoples around. 
        That mostly describes me; you know, there is just something special about programming that drives all of us to it: Whether if it's simplicity, asthetics no one really knows; 
        Maybe it's just a feeling of acomplishment that drives people to build the greatest of programs one has ever seen; we don't know.
        I am on my way to master backend with some sugery front-end drinks added to it; So soon you will be able to realy on me to do the backend with ease; the frontend? --- that's your job!
        Go ahead and have a look around!
